# Coral_adaptation
A repository for code and data related to the Coral Adaptation Project 

Focal Geographies: Palmyra atoll, Line Islands; Moorea, French Polynesia; Curacao, Dutch Caribbean 

This repo includes a small subset of data from a larger project looking at the microbiome of Pocillopora (a coral taxon) colonies from Okinawa. This data subset includes the orthoprojects (maps) from four different sites in Okinawa and the TagLab project files. Sampled Pocillopora colonies were traced with AI-assisted segmentation tools (+/- and four point click tools) via TagLab (https://github.com/cnr-isti-vclab/TagLab) and borders were refined by human annotators. A sample output dataset is provided.
