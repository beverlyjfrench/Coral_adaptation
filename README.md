# coral_adaptation
A repository for code and data related to the Coral Adaptation Project 

Focal Geographies: Palmyra atoll, Line Islands; Moorea, French Polynesia; Curacao, Dutch Caribbean 

This repo includes a small subset of data from a larger project looking at the metagenomes of Pocillopora (a coral taxon) colonies as an example dataset. This data subset includes the orthoprojections (maps) from Moorea and the TagLab project files. Orthoprojections were created with Viscore, a product of the Cultural Heritage Engineering Initiative, by lead developer Vid Petrovic and PI Falko Kuester. (https://chei.ucsd.edu/viscore/) 

Sampled Pocillopora colonies were traced with AI-assisted segmentation tools (+/- and four point click tools) via TagLab (https://github.com/cnr-isti-vclab/TagLab) and borders were refined by human annotators. A sample output dataset is provided.
